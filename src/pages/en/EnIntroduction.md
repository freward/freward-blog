# Introduction

Besides the development of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing,
Reinforcement Learning also achieved suprising results in recent years
and received much attention.
However, tutorials found online often speed up to coding section without
going deeply into math.
This blog is based on the lecture series given by Professor Sergey Levine of UC Berkeley
and the Introduction to Reinforcement Learning book by Professor Sutton and Barto,
You can find the link for the lecture
[here](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)
and the book [here](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf).

This blog will also introduce RL libraries and how to use them.

In RL, reward is important, actions taken by the AI are to
optimize the long-term total reward and crafting a reasonable reward function
is one of the essential conditions for RL algorithms to work. In reality,
a reward is also important to motivate us toward the goal we are aiming for.
Reward function - $f(reward)$ - Frew<i class="fas fa-angle-double-up" ></i>rd is from here.
